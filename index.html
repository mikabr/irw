<meta name="description" content="Open: The data are licensed for reformatting and public reuse. Their provenance is documented and code used to transform original data to meet the IRW data standard is available.Harmonized: The data are formatted to a common standard. The goal of the IRW is to make large quantities of data available for standardized analysis given the common formatting.Item Response: The IRW is comprised of cross-classified item responses. The key element required of data for inclusion in the IRW is that the data need to report individual responses that are cross-classified by the focus of measurement (typically a person) and the measurement tool (typically an item).These datasets in IRW span a wide range of measures; examples include measures of ability in education settings, measures of partisanship based on voting records, and personality measures based on survey questions. Responses can be scored in a variety of ways (dichotomous, polytomous, continuous) and may contain additional data (e.g., response time).">

            <p class="subtitle lead">The Item Response Warehouse (IRW) is a collection of open, harmonized item response datasets.</p>
                  <div>
        <div class="description">
          <ul>
          <li><p>Open: The data are licensed for reformatting and public reuse. Their provenance is documented and code used to transform original data to meet the IRW data standard is available.</p></li>
          <li><p>Harmonized: The data are formatted to a common standard. The goal of the IRW is to make large quantities of data available for standardized analysis given the common formatting.</p></li>
          <li><p>Item Response: The IRW is comprised of cross-classified item responses. The key element required of data for inclusion in the IRW is that the data need to report individual responses that are cross-classified by the focus of measurement (typically a person) and the measurement tool (typically an item).</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>These datasets in IRW span a wide range of measures; examples include measures of ability in education settings, measures of partisanship based on voting records, and personality measures based on survey questions. Responses can be scored in a variety of ways (dichotomous, polytomous, continuous) and may contain additional data (e.g., response time).</p>
